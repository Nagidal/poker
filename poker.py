# set path to Python27
# run cmd in winpdb dir, then start winpdb by "python winpdb.py"
# set path to Python34
# run a new instance of cmd from the dir of poker.py
# type "python <winpdb dir>rpdb2.py -pahoj -d poker.py" (password is "ahoj"
# type 'python "y:\sven\My Dropbox\Dropbox\python\winpdb\rpdb2.py" -pahoj -d poker.py -r requirements.xml -v'
# we need the following keypress routine in order to attach the script to the winpdb debugger (workaround for a bug in rpdb2.py)
