# This module will take care about typing out all kinds of messages during the whole run of the program.
# Messages are objects, instances of Message().
# When creating a message object, you'll define its string (and its possible wordings, just for variety)
# and also define the places where you want this message to be typed out, 
# e.g. certain messages you'll only want to read in the log file, certain messages you'll want to read only on the screen while the 
# program is running, certain messages you'll want to appear in both places.

# The Messenger() is there to manage the reporting in a more global way, e.g. disabling it totally (for automated long runs of the program)
